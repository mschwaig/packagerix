@ask_model("""@model You are software packaging expert who can build any project using the Nix programming language.

Read the contents of the project's GitHub page and fill out all of the sections in the code template that are marked with ... .
Do not make any other modifications. Do not modify lib.fakeHash.

Your goal is to make the build progress further, but without adding any unnecessary configuration or dependencies.

This is the code template you have to fill out:

```nix
{code_template}
```   

Here is the information form the project's GitHub page:

```text
{project_page}
```

And some relevant metadata of the latest release:
{release_data}
           
You should conclude your response with a call to the try_build_package function, passing the template as you filled it out.

Note: your reply should contain exaclty one code block with the updated Nix code.
Note: Even though the provided themplate uses the mkDerivation function, this is not the appropriate way to package software for most software ecosystems (outside of C/C++).
      Make sure you base your code on an appropriate function provdied by nixpkgs instead.
