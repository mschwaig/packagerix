Your task is to read the contents of the project's GitHub page and fill out all of the sections in the code template that are marked with ... .
Do not make any other modifications or additions. Do not modify the included lib.fakeHash.

This is the code template you have to fill out:
```nix

Here is the information form the project's GitHub page:
```text

And some relevant metadata of the latest release:

Note: Your reply should contain exactly one code block with the updated Nix code.
Note: Even though the provided themplate uses the mkDerivation function, this is not the appropriate way to package software for most software ecosystems (outside of C/C++).
      Make sure you base your code on an appropriate function provdied by nixpkgs instead.

Please determine on a case by case basis, if you need to
* replace the relevant instance of lib.fakeHash with the actual value from the error message, or
* make lib.fakeHash and an actual hash value switch places in the Nix code.
